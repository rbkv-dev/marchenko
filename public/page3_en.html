          <p class="lead">Chinbarstvo was a branch of the handicraft industry. It has existed in Ukraine since ancient times. The master who was engaged in this trade was called a chinbar, a tanner, a tanner, a tanner, a mink. The last two names were used for chinbars, which produced rawhide. <br> An enterprise where leather was processed - a tannery or a tannery. <br> Chinbari tanned ("repaired") the skins of animals, making skins from them. Subsequently, separate trades emerged from chinbarstvo - furriery and tinsmithing. <br> At first the removed skins were dried, stretching them. A device such as a saw was used to stretch the skin. It consisted of two sawmills - parallel quadrangular bars, the ends of which passed through the log - a thicker bar. There was a sword on the deck, one end of which was attached to the chop, and the other was attached by a pile. Then the skins were soaked, treated with lime in pits or troughs - in order to free them from the hair and marrow (subcutaneous tissue). Hair was removed with a stroke - an iron spatula. <br> To clean the skins from the carcass (carcass) they were pulled on a mare - a wooden churbak and scraped with a two-handed knife - a planer. The skins were then washed in water and immersed in a tanning solution [10]. <br> For kneading the skin chinbari used a device - a mill. It consisted of a rotating column reinforced in the thrust of a wooden support (log). A wooden disk (circle) equipped with handles (wings) and holes was put on the pillar. There was a slit (stream) in the column, where the skin was placed, clamped to a circle with sticks with heads (spiers with stags), inserting them into the holes, and pressed the skin on top of the second circle. <br> The sheepskin coat was a bit different. Since the wool cover of the leather was preserved for sewing the sheaths, the sheepskins were processed only on one side. After soaking in water, the sheepskin was stretched on saws and carved with a scaffold (pulley, cupboard, pulley) - a wide knife inserted lengthwise into the edge of a wooden board. The cabinet consisted of a wooden handle (pad), blades (shnafi) and ears (in Galicia they were also called antabkas) for their fastening together. Then the skin was soaked again: this time in a cell - rye flour or bran dissolved in salted water. Then it was dried, stretched on saws and kneaded with a special tool - a key. In Hutsuls, the key had the following structure: a key, which had the form of a flat hook with two ribs, was attached to the wooden handle at a corner. The outer edge was sharp and the inner edge was blunt. From the pad down went an iron rod, ending in a short chain (chain), at the end of which was a stirrup (stirrup). During the work, the chinbar inserted his foot into the stirrup, held the pad with his right hand, and had his left on the skin lying under the key. The final process was rubbing the skin with chalk, plaster or alabaster and final cleansing of grease. Finished sheepskins could be painted.</p>
