          <p class="lead">Wood carving is an art for which the ancient Slavs were famous in the XI century. However, art itself arose much earlier. <br> In the XVIII-XIX centuries. carving in Ukraine has reached the highest level. Details of buildings were decorated with carvings - doorposts, slats, beams, platbands, attic boards, attic windows. In the interior of the house carvings were decorated with shutters, shutters, shelves, bowls. The carvers paid special attention to the bastard, which took up more space in the interior. It was often decorated with flat-carved carvings with motifs of rosettes, circles, stripes, broken lines, the side parts were sometimes profiled with twisted ornaments. The tradition of decorating bastards still exists in folk architecture. <br> Masters generously decorated with carvings household and household items. Chests, tables, beds, bowls, plates were decorated with ornamental carvings. Master carvers decorated wooden cemetery and roadside crosses, which were built at crossroads, crossroads, around churches and wells. <br> To this day, unique examples of carved products - milk paints, sledges, various household utensils, household items. <br> In the early 20's art and industrial schools were established in Kiev, Kharkov, Poltava, Pereyaslav. From the second half of the 1920s, young people took an active part in exhibitions together with experienced masters. <br> Wood carving to this day remains one of the national types of applied art of the peoples of our country. <br> One of the oldest ways to decorate wooden products is considered to be flat carving, which was performed with the simplest tools - an ax or a knife. In the Hutsul region it is called: "dry" or "clean". The elements of such a carving are simple geometric shapes formed by a combination of horizontal, vertical and oblique (at an angle of 45-60 degrees) lines. In shallow lines - recesses are sometimes rubbed coal dust or soot with linseed oil, which gives the picture a graphic expressiveness, clarity, bringing it closer to the engraving. This decoration can be seen on old Hutsul chests and tables.</p>
