          <p class="lead">Pottery - making various products from burnt pottery clay, including utensils, tiles, toys, etc. This rather ancient craft originated in the Neolithic era, and later became a kind of folk art. The clay is malleable during molding and quite solid after firing (about 900 °). It has a wide range of natural colors - from white, cream, ocher to red, brown and dark gray. Ceramic paints made of colored clay (engobe), as well as transparent and decorative glazes (glazes) give a magical effect to pottery. <br> Primitive potters formed products by hand, gluing a basket, stone, wooden form with slices of clay mass the thickness of a finger or wrapping a spiral ribbon of clay, gradually gluing and making a cone-shaped vessel with a sharp bottom. The dishes turned out thick-walled, with a violation of the roundness and silhouette of the form. However, this primitive ancient technique withstood competition from the potter's wheel and was well known to the Slavs. <br> The invention of the potter's wheel (IV millennium BC), first manual and slow-turning, and in the Middle Ages high-speed, foot-operated, was a revolution in the development of pottery. The technique of turning on a circle made it possible not only to increase production, but also to improve its artistic level. Dishes made in a circle are quite light, thin-walled, with harmoniously symmetrical outlines of the shape, clear ornamental stripes, lines, etc. <br> In pottery folk masters used several decorating techniques: kicking, polishing, horning, flanding, stamping and modeling. <br> Kicking ("cut", scratching, engraving) is a way of applying a deepened groove with a wooden stick or nail on the surface of a raw shard. <br> Glossing, or polishing, is done with a smooth object (mostly a pebble) on a dry shard of line, strip, etc. <br> When horning, the horn is filled with engobe. A goose feather or a glass tube is inserted into a small hole in its lower part, and a stream of engobe rests on the surface of the product. In modern techniques, the horn is replaced by a rubber bulb. Cutting masters make straight and wavy lines, apply spots, rosettes, leaves and other ornamental elements. Flanders are a connection with a sharp object of three or four ribbons of engobes, like marble stains - clear and zigzag. <br> In pottery today there are four types of products: utensils for various purposes; sacred objects (crosses, icons, candlesticks, etc.); toys; items for housing equipment (tiles, vases, pot holders, etc.). <br> With the formation of the Old Russian state in the X century. the production of pottery is gradually increasing, especially in cities. On products there is at first opaque, and then transparent watering. Ancient Russian potters mostly made korchags for storing grain, bowls, pots, mugs and jugs. <br> In the XIV century. mainly produced cheap and convenient gray utensils for cooking. It was decorated with polishing and wooden stamps in the form of circles with rays, stars, teeth, swallows and more. <br> In the XVII-XVIII centuries. Ukrainian pottery has acquired a higher level of development. The products were painted with engobes and enamels (ceramic glass-like paint), which made it possible to move to multicolor. Prominent place was occupied by floral, floral ornaments, figurative images, especially on bowls and tiles. At this time, among the many Poltava centers of pottery, such as Hlynsk, Zinkiv, Myrhorod, Romny, the most prominent was Opishnya. Here, in 1786, about 200 artisans made a variety of festive utensils for drinks: jugs, eggplants, barrels, kumants and decorative utensils of sculptural nature: lambs, lions, grasshoppers, roosters, etc., decorated with floral ornaments. In Hlynsk, thanks to the work of the Sulim family, the leading painting technique was flanders, sometimes in combination with floral motifs. <br> Dnieper pottery centers - Dybyntsi, Kaniv, Revivka (flooded by the Kremenchug reservoir), Sunky, Tsvitna and others. - were famous not only for solid painted utensils, but also figured for drinks (in the form of animals and birds). <br> In Podillia pottery was produced in Bar, Bubnivka, Haisyn, Letychiv, Smotrych, and others. Bubniv ceramics, in addition to clear plant patterns, had sculpted figures of birds on the tires of jugs, the market and more. <br> The leading centers of pottery in Western Ukraine were Potelych, Yavoriv, ​​Kolomyia, Pustyn, Mukachevo and others. In Kolomyia a pottery shop was established in 1661. In addition to utensils, candlesticks and tiles decorated with flannel and horn were made here. <br> In the XIX century. products of each area of ​​pottery acquired certain features that depended on the natural qualities of materials, technical level of production, local traditions and so on. <br> The products of Opishnian potters were noted for their originality. Thus, Fedor Chervinka, in addition to engraving on a wet shard, pasted embossed ornamental motifs; Vasyl Porosny introduced fairy-tale animals and birds into the weaving of painted floral ornaments. <br> Andriy Honchar (Bubnivka village) stood out among Podolsk potters, who was the first to introduce the production of red painted pottery in his village; Petro Lukashenko and Pavlo Samolovych (Bar) decorated the bowls with thematic figured compositions; Yakiv Batsutsa (Adamivka village) gained popularity far beyond Ukraine with his unglazed spherical-shaped dishes painted with silhouette figures. <br> In the XIX century. Kosiv and Pistyn became the leading centers of pottery in the Hutsul region. Kosiv ceramics gained fame thanks to the original work of Oleksa Bakhmetyuk. His father Petro Bakhmetyuk made unglazed dishes. As a young man, Oleksa studied and worked for the famous master chef Ivan Baranyuk from the suburbs of Kosovo - Moskalivka. Oleksa Bakhmetyuk's own work in the workshop inherited from her father is marked by an original painting of dishes and tiles. Its ornamentation is multi-petalled flowers, triangular leaves, bunches of grapes, birds on branches, horses, goats, deer. Boldly developed floral motifs were called "Bakhmin" here. <br> The work of famous pottery families is connected with the Pistyn center of pottery: Voloshchuk, Sondyuk, Koshak, Mikhalevich, Tymchuk and others. They mostly made painted bowls, plates and jugs. In addition, Petro Tymchuk made original figurines of goats, sheep, and deer with pots on his back - for houseplants. <br> Utensils of various purposes and shapes were made in the ancient pottery centers of Lviv region - Gavarechchyna, Hlynsk, Lagodov, Sasov, Sokal, Shpykolosy, Yavoriv and others. <br> In the 20-30s of the XX century. the folk ceramics of Adamivka, Bar, Dybyntsiv, Opishnya, Shatryshche and other famous centers did not differ from the products of the end of the last century. However, forced collectivization in Ukraine has caused significant damage to pottery. Attempts to establish pottery guilds in many rural centers have failed. The number of artisan potters decreased sharply, as all able-bodied peasants had to work on collective farms. <br> Pottery gained some momentum in the postwar decade. The lack of household utensils led to the rapid resumption of pottery production in Opishnya, Vasylkiv, and Valky. At the same time, pottery guilds were created in ancient centers - Dybyntsi, Bari, Bubnivtsi, Adamivtsi, Smotrychi, Kosovo and others. Outstanding folk masters worked here: Gavrylo Poshivailo (Opishnya), the Gerasimenko brothers (Bubnivka), Oleksandra Pyrizhok (Adamivka), Hryhoriy and Pavlyna Tsvilynky (Kosiv), and others. <br> In the 60's there were still centers of gray ceramics (Settlement of Poltava region. Shatryshche of Sumy, Plakhtyanka of Kyiv, Pastyrske of Cherkasy, Shpykolosa and Gavarechchyna of Lviv), all the beauty of which was concentrated in its form, and a simple shiny pattern emphasized expressiveness and expressiveness. . <br> In the 70's and 80's, Ukrainian pottery was slowly declining. fewer and fewer experienced potters remained. Instead, semi-mechanized ceramic shops and factories were set up to produce mass products that mimicked folk pottery. Ceramic artists from Kyiv, Lviv and Odessa turn to the traditions of folk pottery.</p>
