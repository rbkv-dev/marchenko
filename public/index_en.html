Alya, a small village of Gorky, was honored with the honor of mother Vlasna Pisankarsk school with a characteristic lesser color and ornament. Prior to such accruals, Chorniy Potik is located — a village was wide open, there was a great deal of love for the same time. Chornopototsky Easter eggs are great for rosemaries, but, as it seems, labat, they are valued on the same day by the famous cosmos, as I sign with the main Kosivskyi district.</p>

Vaughn Winla’s was a long time ago and was transmitted from generation to generation. Archaeologists know the doby paleolith, the secret of Mizin in Chernigiv and its analogies, to show the appearance of cherry blossoms on the thorns of Ukraine. At the burial places of the first centuries of our country, there are surpluses of external clothing, codified by the holy vishivka. About Masov, I would like to learn more about virology in Ukraine to comprehend the historical, literary, folklore and speech memories. <br> The old time in parallel with the traditional homemade vishotovlennyam vishivok pobuvuet virobnitstvo vivivanih virobiv in special shops, workshops. Vіdomo, scho at XI century Princess Anna, the sister of Volodimir Monomakh, mothballed the beginning of the vishivka in the monastic schools. Here they instilled vivivati ​​devachat, gaptuvati with gold and thread. Shitting with gold wines on the basis of folk vishivaniya and bulo is broader than in the midst of great-powerful women, women of the princely family.</p>
